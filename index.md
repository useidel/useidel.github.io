After his PhD he has been in several roles: Linux/Unix instructor, sysadmin, senior solution engineer, manager, evangelist, ambassador, enterprise architect, account CTO and Senior CXA. Now he is an CSM for XM Cyber working out of Munich. He regularly attends conferences and publishes articles in computer magazines.
